/*Write a program that applies bonus score to given score in the range [1â€¦9] by the following rules:

    If the score is between 1 and 3, the program multiplies it by 10.
    If the score is between 4 and 6, the program multiplies it by 100.
    If the score is between 7 and 9, the program multiplies it by 1000.
    If the score is less than 0 or more than 9, the program prints "invalid score".
